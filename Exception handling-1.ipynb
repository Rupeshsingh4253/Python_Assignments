    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the \n",
    "program's instructions. Exceptions can be caused by various errors or unexpected conditions and are used to handle \n",
    "exceptional cases gracefully. The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is as follows:\n",
    "Exceptions: These are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected or problematic\n",
    "occurs. Examples of exceptions include division by zero, trying to access a non-existent file, or attempting to index a\n",
    "list with an out-of-bounds index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors:These are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing of code, before the program is executed.\n",
    "    They occur when the code does not follow the correct syntax rules of Python, such as missing colons, incorrect \n",
    "    indentation, or using undefined variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it results in the termination of the program, and an error message is displayed.\n",
    "The error message provides information about the type of exception and where it occurred in the code. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(\"abc\")\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the code attempts to convert the string \"abc\" to an integer, which raises a `ValueError` because the \n",
    "conversion is not possible. Since we have an exception handler for `ZeroDivisionError` (which is not relevant to this code),\n",
    "the unhandled `ValueError` will cause the program to terminate. Python will display an error message like \"ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. \n",
    "To catch and handle exceptions in Python, you can use `try`, `except`, and optionally `else` and `finally` blocks.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero error\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input: Please enter a valid number\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No exceptions occurred. The result is:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This block always executes, whether an exception occurred or not.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block attempts to get user input and perform a division. If a `ZeroDivisionError` or `ValueError` occurs, the respective `except` blocks handle these exceptions. The `else` block is executed if no exceptions occur, and the `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.\n",
    "The `try`, `else`, and `finally` blocks are used to handle exceptions in Python. Here's an example that demonstrates their use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero error\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No exceptions occurred. The result is:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This block always executes, whether an exception occurred or not.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block attempts to get user input and perform a division. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, \n",
    "the program will jump to the `except` block. If no exceptions occur, the code in the `else` block will execute, displaying\n",
    "the result. Regardless of whether an exception was raised, the `finally` block will always execute, displaying the \n",
    "specified message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that allow you to create your own exception types to handle specific\n",
    "error conditions in your code. You may need custom exceptions when the built-in exceptions don't adequately represent the \n",
    "exceptional conditions in your application. Custom exceptions help improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise MyCustomException(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "except MyCustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Custom exception caught:\", e)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input: Please enter a valid number\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a custom exception `MyCustomException`. If the user enters a negative age, we raise this custom\n",
    "exception. By doing this, we can handle this specific condition with more clarity and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. \n",
    "Here's an example of creating a custom exception class and using it to handle an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    if num < 0:\n",
    "        raise MyCustomException(\"Negative numbers are not allowed.\")\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except MyCustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Custom exception caught:\", e)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero error\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No exceptions occurred. The result is:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This block always executes, whether an exception occurred or not.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the custom exception `MyCustomException` is used to handle the case where the user enters a \n",
    "negative number. If a negative number is entered, the custom exception is raised, and the error message is displayed.\n",
    "This allows for more precise and clear handling of this specific error condition."
